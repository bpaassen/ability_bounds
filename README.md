The reference implementation for all confidence bound methods can be found in `ability_bounds.py`. The experimental source code in the notebook `synthetic_experiments.ipynb`.

The source code in this repository depends on [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), and [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/).
